This area is managed by cdjobin for building samples.
GitHub Pages render url: https://openplus.github.io/GCWeb/templates/cradataviz/donut1-en.html

TO-DO: Areas needed updates:
- Layout: e.g. Row 1: 30% filters 60% Donut, Row 2: 100% Bar, Row 3: Table (Then we get Design and UX input)
- Labels: We need to add labels and descriptions (re: not sure what data it is representing), maybe some in panels/wells?
- Source reference: including list which sources we are using for samples.
- OTHER:
 - Table filtering also: Might be some newer HTML5 options: https://wet-boew.github.io/GCWeb/components/wb-data-json/template-en.html


Latest Update Feb 28

Robin: 
- Updated sample site to reflect mock-ups and sample text placeholders
- Mow Mobile Responsive, layouts and general mark-up is all latest GCweb

Catherine:
- Linked the two charts together (the bar chart and the donut chart)
- When you move the cursor over the donut chart, the data now follows the mouse
- I made the 6 mocks-up requested (Files found from the Figma I received from Robin Galipeau):

https://openplus.github.io/GCWeb/templates/cradataviz/donut7-en.html

- The width of the tables has been corrected
- In the template made by Steve, he had added a figure/figure caption around the charts, taken from the table caption (see the example: https://openplus.github.io/GCWeb/templates/cradataviz/donut1-en.html  this example takes the information in the table, instead of a CSV file), I added this possibility with the CSV files


What remains to be done: (although I think we are ready for a team to review design, UX and WCAG now)
- Make $ formating where appropiate (re: donut)
- Review mobile Table horizontol scroll
- Add Breadcrumbs from Figma
- Bar chart small text (alternatives?)
- Make the French version
- I have to ask Robin Galipeau to specify this: Labels: We need to add labels and descriptions (re: not sure what data it is representing), maybe some in panels/wells? (According to the readme: https://github.com/openplus/GCWeb/tree/master/templates/cradataviz )
- Give the possibility to choose colors by entering a parameter
- Some more visual arrangements (transitions mostly, to follow some consistency)

To be revisited :
- Some CSV files were way too complicated, so I had to simplify them. If these files are to be used in their complex form, I'll have to add some features. Here are the three pages where I had to simplify the files:
