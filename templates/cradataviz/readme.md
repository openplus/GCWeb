This area is managed by cdjobin for building samples.
GitHub Pages render url: https://openplus.github.io/GCWeb/templates/cradataviz/donut1-en.html

TO-DO: Areas needed updates:
- Layout: e.g. Row 1: 30% filters 60% Donut, Row 2: 100% Bar, Row 3: Table (Then we get Design and UX input)
- Labels: We need to add labels and descriptions (re: not sure what data it is representing), maybe some in panels/wells?
- Mobile: Responsive test, layouts and sizes.
- Source reference: including list which sources we are using for samples.
- OTHER:
 - Pop-up/Hover on Donut
 - Donut data value Total in center (Magda what is the data?)
 - Table filtering also
