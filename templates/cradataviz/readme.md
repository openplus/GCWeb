This area is managed by cdjobin for building samples.
GitHub Pages render url: https://openplus.github.io/GCWeb/templates/cradataviz/donut1-en.html

TO-DO: Areas needed updates:
- Layout: e.g. Row 1: 30% filters 60% Donut, Row 2: 100% Bar, Row 3: Table (Then we get Design and UX input)
- Labels: We need to add labels and descriptions (re: not sure what data it is representing), maybe some in panels/wells?
- Source reference: including list which sources we are using for samples.
- OTHER:
 - Table filtering also: Might be some newer HTML5 options: https://wet-boew.github.io/GCWeb/components/wb-data-json/template-en.html


Recently DONE:
- Catherine updates (Dec/Jan?)
- Mobile: Responsive test, layouts and sizes.
